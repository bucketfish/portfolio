          <p>Tambourine Story was created for <b>Swift Student Challenge 2024</b>. It's a rhythm game — but instead of tapping the screen like most rhythm games, it asks the user to shake the iPad like a real-life tambourine.</p>
          <p>This game is my tribute to music and collaboration — how each and every one of us are able to be a part of something greater than ourselves, through collaborative art, through playing together.</p>
          <p>The project won Distinguished Winner in Swift Student Challenge and was featured on various platforms, such as <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/today/ground-up/love-video-games-child-led-student-top-award-apple-hq-america-4647466" target="_blank">ChannelNewsAsia</a>, <a href="https://elle.com.sg/life-culture/asian-students-apple-swift-challenge-2024/" target="_blank">ELLE Singapore</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/story/id1748957781" target="_blank">the App Store</a>.</p>
          <p>The project was also <a href="https://esquiresg.com/apples-tim-cook-meets-with-regional-game-devs/" target="_blank">presented to Tim Cook</a> when he visited Singapore in April 2024, as well as at Apple Developer Center Singapore.</p>

        <p>The <b>story</b> follows a little girl's journey of trying to join her brother's band, and the player shares her experience of being included in the practice session for the first time.</p>

        <p>I was inspired to create this game by a band that I started with my friends a few years ago and the wondrous feeling I experienced when we had our rehearsal for the first time, hearing the song come together. It felt like we were a part of something special. I created Tambourine Story to capture this feeling I had, of the human nature of yearning for arts and harmony.</p>
        <p>The physical motion of the device was inspired by Phyphox, an app used for Physics Practical lessons in school to record device motion for data analysis purposes.</p>

            <h1>Technical details</h1>
            <p>Created entirely in Swift and SwiftUI, Tambourine Story draws on the potential of <b>CoreMotion</b> and <b>SceneKit</b> to make the game more immersive and interactive.</p>
            <p>The tambourine was modeled using <b>Blender</b> and imported using SceneKit to be rendered into the game in its 3D form.</p>
            <p>CoreMotion uses the device's accelerometer to detect shakes of the tambourine, as well as tilting of the camera to rotate the scene.</p>

          <h1>Art details</h1>
          <p>Drawn with <b>Clip Studio Paint</b>, the characters in the game have many emotions to represent them during dialogue. The base — default smile — was drawn first, then the other emotions iterated upon.</p>
          <p>The main character was then animated for the jumping animation when the tambourine is played. The inspiration from this animation comes from Thomas the Tank Engine lyric video, with a ball jumping across the lyrics.</p>

          <p>The background also took a significant amount of time as I was unhappy with the first version of it. It took some re-painting to get the correct feel of the game down, but it was definitely worth it in the end.</p>

            <p>The music was composed in <b>Garageband</b>. The first piece is simple and short — it loops to ensure that the player knows how to play and can hit a minimum accuracy before continuing. The second begins build up in intensity as the game progresses.</p>
